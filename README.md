# Graph Visualization and Algorithmic Exploration Tool

## Overview
This project is an **interactive graph visualization tool** designed to bridge the gap between theoretical graph concepts and hands-on learning. Built with Python for user interaction and C for algorithmic efficiency, this tool enables users to intuitively build, modify, and explore graphs while leveraging the computational power of C for heavy-duty tasks.

As students, we faced challenges in grasping graph theory concepts. To make the learning process easier and more engaging for others, we developed this tool as a visual and interactive aid. By combining visualization, interactivity, and advanced algorithms, we hope to make graph theory more approachable for everyone.

## Features
### Interactive Graph Building
- **Node Management**: Add or remove nodes directly on the screen using the mouse and keyboard.
- **Edge Creation**: Connect nodes with edges interactively.
- **Graph Randomization**: Generate a random graph to experiment with pre-defined structures.
- **Visualization Customization**: Modify graph properties such as edge weights, colors, and layouts.

### Integrated Algorithms
- All algorithms are implemented in C for performance optimization.
- The Python interface seamlessly calls these C functions for tasks such as:
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** with real-time path visualization.
  - Weighted shortest-path calculations.
  - Advanced graph analysis (e.g., cycle detection, spanning trees).

### Learning-Oriented Design
- Step-by-step execution and visualization of algorithms.
- Real-time feedback to understand how graph operations affect the structure.
- Detailed insights into algorithmic processes.
